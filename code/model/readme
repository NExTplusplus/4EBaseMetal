This folder contains the code for each machine learning model, each model per file. Note that the different version of one model (e.g., LSTM and AttLSTM) could be in different files.

Files:
arma_garch.py   The implementation of the ARMA_GARCH model, the documentation could be found in: https://wiki.alphien.com/ALwiki/ARMA_GARCH_Documentation 
base_predictor.py   This is the base class for a prediction model that implement the basic inferface of a predictor. 
cnn_lstm_keras.py   The implementation of a hybrid neural network with CNN + LSTM architecture.
logistic_regression.py  The implementation of LR, documentation: https://wiki.alphien.com/ALwiki/Logistic_Regression_Documentation
lstm.py The implementation of LSTM, documentation: https://wiki.alphien.com/ALwiki/LSTM
