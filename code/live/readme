This folder contains the live code for training each machine learning model, tuning each model best parameter and test each model lively.

if you want to use the model in live folder, you need to do the below three steps:
1. make a file under code folder, such as train_data.py
2. import the model in new file
3. run the folder in command and input the parameter:
python train_data.py -s 3 -gt LME_Co_Spot -max_iter 100 -sou NExT -l 5 -v "v9" -o "train" -d '2016-05-01' -C 0.001

If you run the test you can see the result like below:
         date  result
0   2016-01-04     1.0
1   2016-01-05     1.0
2   2016-01-06     1.0
3   2016-01-07     1.0
4   2016-01-08     0.0
..         ...     ...
78  2016-04-25     0.0
79  2016-04-26     0.0
80  2016-04-27     1.0
81  2016-04-28     1.0
82  2016-04-29     0.0

The meaning of the above result=1.0, for example, is that you input horizon=3 in command and the result of 2016-04-29 means the price in 2016-05-02 is higher than price in 2016-04-29.
